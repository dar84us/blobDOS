# blobDOS
blobDOS is a lightweight Windows Terminal replacement built in C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2).   It features real command history, supports core terminal commands, and prevents unsafe actions like deleting critical system files (e.g., System32).    Created by Darius Lacurezeanu under System56 during a one-month vacation in Mangalia, Romania.
